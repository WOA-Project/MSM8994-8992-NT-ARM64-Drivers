This is the original arm64 driver from Nokia meant for Hapanero devices.
It is not recompiled from a sample source code repository.
It does not support right click, is fairly stable, but only works on Hapanero for some reason.
It also requires some screen metric fixups, provided in the INF for conveniance.
